                     There’s this Sylvia Plath poem called Mad Girl’s Love Song.
                     It might just be the epitome of teen romance, but alas,
                     discrediting one’s own desire to be loved is yet another
                     byproduct of (say it with me) misogyny. I think that’s
                     really what it is to be a teenage girl. To love. Not just
                     boys, of course. Girls, too. And the wind. And the sea. And
                     Sylvia Plath. It can be difficult to love yourself when you
                     are thrust into a world hell-bent on turning you into
                     something you’re not. Capitalism, Eurocentrism, misogyny,
                     you name it. These tremendous, intangible forces are to
                     blame for deep trauma. Something as simple as growing out
                     body hair becomes unduly politicized, almost Kafkaesque in
                     nature. Because, having jurisdiction over our own
                     appearances and behaviors would first require society to
                     admit that we are autarkic to the core; able to depend on
                     ourselves to learn and understand the world. It makes sense
                     though. If we had full autonomy, we wouldn’t be exploited
                     and targeted for consumerist purposes. So we’re stripped of
                     cultural capital, rendered obsolete in intellectual
                     circles. Change is guaranteed from the start, that much is
                     true. But it seems almost prefigured that we will grow into
                     individuals accepting of our circumstances. It’s not the
                     growing up that’s the problem, it’s losing the teenageness.
                     The innate rebellion, the fervor for life. It’s when we
                     don’t belong to anyone that we are at our most potent, for
                     lack of a better word. Soon corporate America and the
                     Western dating scene (insert distant church bells) auction
                     off every ounce of individual sovereignty until we’re
                     merely conduits for reproduction and labor. That’s not to
                     say that working women and mothers don’t have strength or
                     can’t create change, just that things get muddled.
                     Responsibilities emerge, mortgages need to be paid,
                     children fed. The aliveness is deadened. In that later
                     stage of life, there’s more to live for than just yourself.
                     The same can’t be said for the teenage girl, whose
                     vehemence is fueled by the very thing it stands to
